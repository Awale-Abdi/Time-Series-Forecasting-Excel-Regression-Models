<h1 align="center">Hardware Retail Sales Forecasting – Excel Time Series Models Over 15 Years (2005–2020)</h1>

This Excel-based time series forecasting project analyzes 15 years of U.S. hardware and tools retail sales data to generate a 12-month predictive sales forecast. Completed as part of a graduate-level **Supply Chain Analytics** course, the assignment placed me in the role of a **Supply-Chain Analyst** tasked with producing a highly accurate monthly sales forecast to inform internal resource planning—materials, staffing, and financial capacity for the upcoming fiscal year.

The core analysis—including model construction, validation, and communication—was performed in under **90 minutes as part of a timed 3-hour project**, simulating a real-world corporate decision-making environment. The task required evaluating industry sales data (Sep 2005–Aug 2020), forecasting future demand (Sep 2020–Aug 2021), and benchmarking against actual 2021 results.

📊 A separate *Forecast vs. Actual Sales* validation sheet is included to compare the forecast against real 2021 Census retail sales figures. This comparison demonstrates forecast realism and business applicability using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and trend visualization.

The final forecast is presented in a concise executive summary tailored for operational stakeholders, delivering clear, actionable insights. Also included is a reusable Time Series Forecasting Playbook authored to document the complete modeling workflow. It serves as both a practical forecasting guide and evidence of applied proficiency in time series forecasting techniques using Excel.

## 🎯 Objective

To forecast monthly U.S. hardware retail sales for the 12-month period of September 2020 to August 2021 using multiple regression models. This forecast is intended to support resource planning in supply chain, staffing, and financial operations.

Key goals:
- Identify trends and monthly seasonality in historical data  
- Apply and compare multiple forecasting models in Excel  
- Evaluate models using Adjusted R² and RMSE  
- Compare forecast to actual U.S. Census retail data  
- Communicate insights clearly for operational leadership  
- Provide a reusable modeling framework for future use

## 📘 Time Series Forecasting Playbook – Excel Models

This project includes a comprehensive Excel-based forecasting playbook authored by me. It outlines the complete process for setting up, executing, and evaluating time series models. Designed for reuse, the playbook was created with the intention of supporting future students, professionals, and teams working with Excel-based forecasting—whether in academic, operational, or business planning contexts.

It covers how to:
- Clean and prepare time-indexed sales data  
- Create period indices and seasonal dummy variables  
- Generate seasonal indices using moving averages  
- Build and evaluate multiple regression models in Excel  
- Compute error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAPE)  
- Visualize actual vs. forecasted sales  
- Benchmark forecast performance against real-world results  

### Models Covered:
- Linear Regression  
- Exponential Regression  
- Quadratic Regression  
- Linear Regression with Dummy Variables  
- Exponential Regression with Dummy Variables  
- Quadratic Regression with Dummy Variables  
- Deseasonalized Linear Regression  
- Deseasonalized Exponential Regression  
- Deseasonalized Quadratic Regression
